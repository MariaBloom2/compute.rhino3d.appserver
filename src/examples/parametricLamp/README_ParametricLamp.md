## Description

Parametric-Lamp is an interactive web-based application, which enables the user to select his desired size and shape of a wooden lamp. 
The user can change the values of the following sliders:

- the total width
- the total height
- the number of the edges in the top/ bottom view
- the rotation in z axis
- the width of the upper/ lower part
- the width of the middle part
- the density of the wooden slices
- the width of the wooden slices
- and the thickness of the wooden slices


## Grasshopper Plug-ins

Currently the web-based application is not using any grasshopper plug-ins, but only native components. 
However in the future development of the application the use of OpenNest (a free open-source digital fabrication plug-in) will be desired. 
This plug-in will enable the user (after setting the size and shape of his favourite) to directly get the slices of the lamp projected on a horizontal plane. 
This horizontal plane will have the exact size needed for a CNC or a laser cutter.
